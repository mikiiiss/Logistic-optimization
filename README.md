# Logistic-optimization
##about
This week’s client Gokada is the largest last mile delivery service company in Nigeria. It provides parcel delivery services facilitated by motorbike owners and drivers(pilots) in Lagos, Nigeria. Even Though, Gokada has been able to complete over one million deliveries, it has faced a sub-optimal placement of pilots as it tries to expand its services. This has led to a high number of unfulfilled delivery requests. In order to better understand the root reasons of unfilled requests and develop solutions that suggest driver locations that boost the percentage of complete orders, Gokada wants to analyze its data. Since drivers are compensated according to the quantity of requests they take, this week’s solution will benefit Gokada by increasing customer satisfaction and generating more revenue.
